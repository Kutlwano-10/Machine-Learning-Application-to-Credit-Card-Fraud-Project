Hello!

I am excited about machine learning and have decided to take on this project as the first of many to become more comfortable with the models used.

This project focuses on credit card fraud and aims to analyze a dataset of transactions to predict whether each transaction is fraudulent or not.
We focused on using "class" as our target feature because it simplifies the classification of fraudulent and valid transactions. We employed feature importance analysis to identify 
the most relevant features for our models, selecting the most impactful ones for optimization. Our results indicate that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) consistently outperformed the other models, both before and after optimization, while the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) exhibited the weakest performance. Interestingly, we observed that the LOF model is particularly effective at identifying 
normal transactions. This raises an important question: Is this behavior driven by the hyperparameters we used or by the selected features? Further investigation is required to determine the 
underlying cause.
